  Hello, I am a Graphic Designer and Illustrator who enjoys all the nerdy stuff and computer games in my spare time. I studied Graphic Design at Fleming College and spent some time at the Ontario College for Art and Design University learning how to draw and studying Interactive Design. This website is my portfolio as well as my delve back into web development. </p>

  
  Relearning HTML5 and CSS has been an enlightening experience. As a child I studied web design with two friends and a small hosted site, our parents all worked in IT and set it up for us so we could all explore.
