  Hello, I'm not quite sure how you got here. Whether you saw me online and tried to google me, or you want to hire me. Either way, welcome and thanks for taking the time to look around.</p>
I am a Graphic Designer and Illustrator who enjoys all the nerdy stuff and computer games in my spare time. I studied Graphic Design at Fleming College and spent some time at the Ontario Academy for Art and Design learning how to draw and studying Interactive Design. This website is my portfolio as well as my delve back into web development.
