  Hello, I'm not quite sure how you got here, but you either saw me online and tried to google me, or you want to hire me. Either way, welcome and thanks for taking the time to look around. I am a Graphic Designer and sometimes artist who enjoys all the nerdy stuff and computer games in my spare time. I studied Graphic Deasign at Fleming College and spent some time at the Ontario Academy for Art and Design learning how to draw and studying Art History.
